Chat app built with React/NodeJs and Socket for real-time chatting.

# Starting the application - Docker

This application is dockerized. Ensure your system has docker installed. Enter docker compose up in the root directory of the project. 

There might be some error related to dependencies. Enter docker compose up again. Project will run. 

For safety purpose, I have deleted .env file from the project. You can get env by messaging me directly. Thanks. 

# Starting the application without docker. 

If you don't have docker in your system, go to the sub folders client, server and socket. Install dependencies with Yarn/NPM and hit npm start / yarn start.
